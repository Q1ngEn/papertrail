# papertrail
papertrail is a webapp in which subject reps can charge an amount for worksheet and notes and allow students to deposite large amount of money smoothly

it is built with flask with flask-sqlalchemy, flask-login and flask-bcrypt with wtforms

There was a lot of challenges with many new software being used that I need to learn

I am proud of the login system that functions quite well to my knowledge

I have learnt how to use sqlalchemy and flask-login and became more familiar with wtforms

There is a need to store transations and the need to store student subjects needed
