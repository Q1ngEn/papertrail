# papertrail
papertrail is a webapp in which subject reps can charge an amount for worksheet and notes and allow students to deposite large amount of money smoothly, how to use it is to login and there is a deposit page to deposit money and a charge page to charge money for a certain subject worksheets or notes

it is built with flask with flask-sqlalchemy, flask-login and flask-bcrypt with wtforms

There was a lot of challenges with many new software being used that I need to learn, the one that stands out to be would be during deployment the email validator does not work and I needed to remove it during deployment

I am proud of the login system that functions quite well to my knowledge, with the different features of the login like needing to log in to access some passage and method I had used to secure the password with the password hashing

I have learnt how to use sqlalchemy and flask-login and became more familiar with wtforms and hope to apply these when building more webapps and I hope to learn more about how to deploy

There is a need to add multiclass tutorial group functionality, and different amount of access with the roles of student and class leader, and more validation for the deposit like sending a request to the class leader to confirm that the money has been transfered to them
